# fee-calculation

##Introduction

this helps in calculating exam or application fee of a student based on the json data provided.

##Technologies

- Angular (version used - 11.2.14)
- html
- css
- bootstrap


##Setup

- First you need to install node.js(version used- 14.15.5) and npm in your system, then run"ng new Project_name" to create a new project. 
- After creating the project, replace "src" and "package.json" of the project with this one.
- Then run "npm i" in your project folder to install all the required dependencies(bootstrap, formsModule).
- Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run "ng s" or "ng serve" to run the application.

##Assumptions

- Data doesnt need to be saved.
- arrays for each dropdown is hardcoded.
- simple UI needs to be created with a simple heading.

##Scope of improvements

- UI could be improved(like aligning all the items in a line and dropdowns can be done using bootstrap,etc).
- array for dropdown can be taken from the json instead of hardcoding it.
- option can be given to select both application and exam fee to get a total amount for both the things.
